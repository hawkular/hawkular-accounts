  <name>Hawkular - Accounts - Feature Pack Resources</name>
  <description>
    This Maven module exists solely because wildfly-server-provisioning-maven-plugin is able to load the subsystem
    fragments (see src/main/resources/subsystem-templates/*) only from jars that are pulled by some WildFly module.
    Projects that have WildFly modules usually pack this kind of resources inside one of the modules' jars.
    Although we do not need a WildFly module to run any code, we need to have one just for the sake of loading the
    subsystem-templates by wildfly-server-provisioning-maven-plugin.
    Once Hawkular Accounts will have a subsystem or a WildFly module, the resources hosted here can move there.
